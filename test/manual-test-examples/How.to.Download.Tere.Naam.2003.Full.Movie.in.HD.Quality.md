## Tere Naam 2003 Movie Review
 
Tere Naam is a classic Bollywood film that was released in 2003. Directed by Satish Kaushik and starring Salman Khan and Bhumika Chawla, the movie tells the story of a college student who falls in love with a woman from a lower social class and the challenges they face as a result of their relationship. The movie is a remake of the 1999 Tamil film Sethu, which was also remade in several other languages.
 
The movie received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike, who praised Salman Khan's performance as Radhe, the music by Himesh Reshammiya and Sajid-Wajid, the cinematography by Tapan Malviya and the emotional quotient of the story. The movie was a huge hit at the box office and became one of the highest-grossing films of 2003. The movie also won several awards and nominations, including four Filmfare Awards and six Screen Awards.
 
However, the movie also faced some criticism for its portrayal of a toxic and abusive relationship between Radhe and Nirjara, which some viewers found disturbing and regressive. Some critics also pointed out the flaws in the screenplay, editing and direction, which made the movie drag at some places. The movie also sparked controversy for its depiction of violence, mental illness and religious sentiments.
 
Despite its drawbacks, Tere Naam remains one of the most memorable films of Salman Khan's career and one of the best Hindi films of the 2000s. The movie has a cult following among fans who still remember it for its songs, dialogues, scenes and emotions. The movie also launched Bhumika Chawla's career in Bollywood, who later went on to work in several other films across industries.
